# Cyber Attacks Analysis (Interactive dashboard creation using Power Bi)
## Project Objective
Cyber Security agency wants to analyze on Cyber Attacks from 2020-2023. So that, they understand attack trends from different states. Also analyze traffic types, action taken, network segments, etc. to find some patterns and work on it to reduce the cyber attacks.
## Dataset used
<a href="https://github.com/aniketedgaonkar/Cyber_Attacks_Analysis/blob/main/cybersecurity_attacks.csv">Dataset</a>
## Questions (KPIs)
o	Top 10 states of cyber attacks? <br>
o	Trend of attacks by Year <br>
o	Different action taken on attacks <br>
o	Which is security levels got attacked most? <br>
o	Analyze attack signatures, traffic types and network segments. <br>
o	Analyze Anomaly score of attacks. <br>
## Dashboard

## Technologies Used:-
Power BI: For data visualization and dashboard creation.<br>
Data Sources: Utilized sales data from Excel file to derive meaningful insights.
## Project Insights 
1. Total Cyber Attacks are around 40K from 2020 to 2023.
2. Manipur, Uttar Pradesh, Gujrat and Maharashra are top states of cyber atttacks.
3. Anomaly score is less as compared to previous years. So conclude that similar types of attacks occuring continuously.
4. Action taken on attacks are blocked, ignored and logged.
5. Number of attacks are greatly reduced from 2022. As number drops from 10K to 8K.
6. Even if security level is high, it get attacked by attackers.
7. Mostly attack types are DDOS and Intrusion.
